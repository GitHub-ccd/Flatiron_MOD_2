# Hypothesis Testing - Recap

## Introduction

You just learned how to create an experiment and interpret the results! Let's review some of the specific things you have learned.

## Key Takeaways

Some of the key takeaways from this section include:
* It's important to have a sound approach to experimental design to be able to determine the significance of your findings
* Start by examining any existing research to see if it can shed light on the problem you're studying
* Start with a clear alternative and null hypothesis for your experiment to "prove"
* It's important to have a thoughtfully selected control group from the same population for your trial to distinguish effect from variations based on population, time or other factors
* Your sample size needs to be selected carefully to ensure your results have a good chance of being statistically significant
* Your results should be reproducible by other people and using different samples from the population
* The p-value for an outcome determines how likely it is that the outcome could occur under the null hypothesis
* $\alpha$ is the marginal threshold at which we're comfortable rejecting the null hypothesis
* An $\alpha$ value of 0.05 is a common choice for many experiments
* Effect size measures just the size of the difference between two groups under observation, whereas statistical significance combines effect size with sample size
* A one sample t-test is used to determine whether a sample comes from a population with a specific mean 
* A two sample t-test is used to determine if two population means are equal
* Type 1 errors (false positives) are when we accept an alternative hypothesis which is actually false
* The $\alpha$ that we pick is the likelihood that we will get a type 1 error due to random chance
* Type 2 errors (false negatives) are when we reject an alternative hypothesis which is actually true
* Resampling methods allow for improved precision in estimating sample statistics and validating models by using random subsets
* Common resampling techniques include bootstrapping, jackknifing and permutation tests
